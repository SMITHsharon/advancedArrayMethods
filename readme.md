### Project Specs
#### `JavaScript` basics
Various `JavaScript` coding syntax and constructs were demonstrated and discussed, including:
- integer operations
- chaining integer methods
- looping through object arrays
- chaining array methods

The various `JavaScript` files underwent many changes throughout the class discussion, with additions and deletions. Part of the discussion was lost from the final *saves*. 


### Technologies Used
- `JavaScript`


### How To View The Screen 
#### (Node must be installed on your machine):
```
git clone https://github.com/SMITHsharon/advancedArrayMethods.git
cd advancedArrayMethods
npm install http-server -g
http-server -p 8080
```

This will show in your browser at: `http://localhost:8080`

You must open the Developer Console to view the `JavaScript` output (`console.log()`s).
