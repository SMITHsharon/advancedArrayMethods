### Project Specs
#### `JavaScript` basics
Various `JavaScript` coding syntax and constructs were demonstrated and discussed, including:
- integer operations
- chaining integer methods
- looping through object arrays
- chaining array methods

The various `JavaScript` files underwent many changes throughout the class discussion, with additions and deletions. Part of the discussion was lost from the final *saves*. 


### Technologies Used
- `JavaScript`
